# my-app
This website is a sample website created for self project requirement purpose provided by TEN (The Entrepreneurship Network ).
I have used React Js to create this website-design.
I included most of the features (front-end ) only!

I used components, props, and hooks concept in several areas of my project.

I also tried to keep the code as clean as possible.

Last but not the least, I will be trying to add new features and will also try to improvize the code in the coming days.
Thanks for staying with me till here :)
