                            <h3>I thoroughly enjoyed my internship during this pandemic situation and gained valuable experience under my belt. I know this internship will be instrumental in getting myself a job and it would be glowing reference on my CV. I was very hesitant at the time of joining TEN due to my inexperience, but now I feel so happy that I was able to be a part of it as it has made me so much more confident and empowered. As much as this organization changes, I hope that itâ€™s class remains constant.

Thank you team TEN!</h3>
